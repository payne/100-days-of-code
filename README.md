This repository started as a fork of [Kallaway's](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code); I've tweaked it so it looks ok via GitHub
pages and I'm putting the log in reverse chronological order. I'll also track things on [CodeHalf](https://codehalf.com/dashboard).

My goals for these [100 days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) include:

1. A focus on https://learn.freecodecamp.org/ I'm starting with [448 points](https://www.freecodecamp.org/payne).
2. If there is time or inclination, progress on some open source applications that use FireBase.com:

### Firebase ideas

1. Omaha Tech Ambasadors
2. Road Chassers
3. Journalling application
4. Tracey's Grid application
